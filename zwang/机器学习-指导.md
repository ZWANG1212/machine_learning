# How a data scientist would go about working through a problem?

Overview

1. Understand the shape of the data(Histograms, box plots, etc.)
2. Data cleaning
3. Data exploration
4. Feature engineering
5. Data preprocessing of the model
6. Basic model building
7. Model tuning
8. Ensemble module building
9. Results

Project planning

1. Understand nature of the data .info() .describe()
2. Histograms and boxplots
3. Value counts
4. Missing data
5. Correlation between the metrics
6. Explore interesting themes
    1. Wealthy survive?
    2. By location?
    3. Age scatterplot with ticket price
    4. Young and wealthy variable?
    5. Total spent?
7. Feature engineering
8. Preprocessing data together or use a transformer?
    * use label for train and test
9. Scaling?
10. Model baseline
11. Model comparison with CV
